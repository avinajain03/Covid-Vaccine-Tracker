# Covid-Vaccine-Tracker-Tableau
The Tableau project for COVID-19 vaccination tracker aims to provide an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that monitors and analyzes the progress of vaccination efforts worldwide. Utilizing Tableau's data visualization capabilities, the project integrates real-time vaccination data from reliable sources. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights such as vaccination rates, share of people fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated, regional comparisons, vaccination doses on daily basis and correlation between vaccination and GDP. 

Users can filter and drill down into specific countries or regions, allowing them to assess the effectiveness and impact of vaccination campaigns. The project aims to empower decision-makers, health officials, and the general public with valuable information to track vaccination progress and make informed decisions in combating the pandemic.
